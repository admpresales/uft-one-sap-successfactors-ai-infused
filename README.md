# uft-one-sap-successfactors-ai-infused
This script works against SAP SuccessFactors.  There is a pre-requisite that you stand up your own instance, and update the URL, user name, and password with your environment details before it will run.  It will login, navigate to Recruiting, add a new Candidate, navigate to that new candidate, then back out of the application.
